A Project done to reflect on and practice the learnings of Express JS

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that simplifies server setup, request handling, and routing. It uses middleware to process requests, parse data, handle errors, and send responses efficiently. Its modular design and rich ecosystem make it ideal for building scalable web apps and APIs.


Here’s what makes it powerful and easy to use:

Easy Server Initialization – Allows you to quickly set up a server with just a few lines of code, without manually handling low-level HTTP modules.

Request Handling – Provides a clean way to receive and process incoming requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) with built-in support for routing based on HTTP methods and paths.

Routing System – Offers a robust routing mechanism to organize your application into multiple endpoints and route handlers, making the code more maintainable.

Middleware Support – Lets you use middleware functions to handle tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, parsing request bodies (JSON, URL-encoded), serving static files, etc.

Automatic Parsing & Formatting – Converts request payloads into readable formats and automatically sets appropriate HTTP headers for responses, so you don’t have to manually serialize/deserialize data.

Extensible & Modular – Easily integrates with other libraries and packages from the npm ecosystem for features like databases, sessions, cookies, and templating engines.

Error Handling – Built-in support for centralized error handling, which keeps your code cleaner and easier to debug.

Performance & Scalability – Lightweight and unopinionated, giving you flexibility to structure your project as you wish, while still supporting large-scale applications.
